# CMDprior
These jupyter notebooks lay out how to simply generate Galaxy priors using the [GDR2mock](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130g4101R) catalogue and they can also help to get a quick interface with the [isochrones](https://github.com/timothydmorton/isochrones) and [brutus](https://github.com/joshspeagle/brutus) isochrone fitting packages.

# Running the jupyter notebooks
In order to run those jupyter notebooks on your local machine you will need to install a few necessary packages. You will also need some additional data in the data folder in order to run the brutus package. If you do not want to run the ADQL-TAP queries yourself, you can download the GDR2mock samples used in the notebooks together with the brutus data from [here](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/51feb58454a5450f9cf4/).

# Example science case
In particular they were used in the following science paper: Arxiv reference

# Attribution
If you use those notebooks in your science please cite: ASCL reference
Also cite the relevant packages and catalogues used.
